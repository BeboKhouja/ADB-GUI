# How to contribute
Thank you for contributing to ADB GUI. If you have any questions, please ask me in my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/y6AcUNTKxX).

In this guide, I will learn you how to contribute.

# Getting Started
Please try to follow the committing style if you want to contribute, it makes the repository much more clean and consistent.
- Do not squash commits
- Explain what the commit does or what did you do in the commit message with less than 50 characters
- Use the commit description if you can't fit what you did in the commit message
- Use one of these prefixes in your commit messages:
    - `fix` When you fixed a bug or a flaw within the codebase.
    - `feature` When you added something within the codebase (can be anything).
    - `tweak` When you do a little tweak in the codebase, like a tiny UI change.
    - `minor` When you fix something, but it doesn't affect the app in terms of functionality.
    - `refactor` When you refactored the code, like cleaning up the code.
