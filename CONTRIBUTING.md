# How to contribute
Thank you for contributing to ADB GUI. If you have any quesions please ask me in my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/y6AcUNTKxX).

In this guide I will learn you how to contribute.

# Getting Started
Please do try to follow the committing style if you wanted to contribute, it makes the repository much more clean and consistent.
- Do not squash commits
- Explain what the commit does or what did you do in the commit message with less than 50 characters
- Use the commit description if you can't fit what you did in the commit message
- Use one of these prefixes in your commit messages:
    - `fix` When you fixed a bug or maybe a flaw within the codebase
    - `feat` When you added something within the codebase (can be anything)
    - `tweak` When you do a little tweak in the codebase, like a tiny UI change
    - `chore` When you do fix something, but it doesn't affect the app in terms of functionality
    - `refactor` When you refactored the code, like cleaning up the code
